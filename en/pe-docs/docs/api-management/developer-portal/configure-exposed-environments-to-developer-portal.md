# Configure Exposed Environments to Developer Portal

The Choreo Developer Portal enables external developers to discover and consume APIs published by your organization. Through the Choreo Console, you can manage which API environments are visible and accessible in the Developer Portal.

Follow these steps to configure which environments are visible in the Developer Portal:

!!! Note -
    Organizations created after **April 24th, 2025**, will have the **Production** environment exposed by default. Organizations created before this date will continue to allow all environments visible in the Developer Portal.

1. Sign in to [Choreo](https://console.choreo.dev/).

2. In the Choreo Console, go to the top navigation menu and click **Organization**. Then select your organization. 

3. In the left navigation menu, click **Settings**. Under the **API Management** tab, go to **Developer Portal**.

4. Expand the **Environments** section and configure the environments exposed to the Developer Portal.
